    <h1> Welcome to my website!</h1>
                
    
    <p>Hi there! This is my very first website that I have ever completely coded by myself. 
    Withinn this website, you will find other projects that I've worked on throughout this first semester. 
    I will showcase a couple of poster designs, different types of typography, and much more.
    Having no expierence of coding before coming to this class, I feel very proud to showcase my work to everyone!
    Without further adue, here are multiple examples of different types of typography.

<section class="type-section">
    <h2 class="type-header">Typography Section</h2>
    <div class="typocontainer">
    <div class="typography_item">
        <img class = "type-image" src="images/axialtest-01.png">
       <p class ="writing">This is my example of using axial typography.  I decided to use simplicity to my advantage, and created a slanted design starting from the top left of the poster, with a solid green line passing through the page. This created a perspective that allowed the text within the poster to be read more clearly. As you read the text, your eye travels in a flowing motion that shows the entirety of the poster, from top down.
        </p>

    <div class="typography_item">
    <img class = "type-image" src="images/bilateraltest-01.png" >
    <p class="writing"> Bilateral typography is commonly used in menus at restaurants for easy reading and clarity. I wanted to create a menu feel within my design, so it would let the viewer gather the information they need to know at just a slight glance. I centered my text, and went down in a list form that showcased all of the important information. To make the poster a little more interesting, I made sure that both my text and design were slightly off from the middle of the page. I also added different shades of green to make a circular/moon shape behind the text.
 
    </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="typography_item">
    <img class = "type-image" src="images/dilatational-01.png">
    <p class="writing">For this typographic system, I wanted to have an almost bubble-like effect on the text. I designed it to be read from the top left of the poster down, almost as if the viewer is reading it in sections. I added green circles below some of the text sections to attract the eye, showing that what they are reading is important to the event taking place. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="typography_item">
    <img class = "type-image" src="images/grid3-01.jpg">
    <p class="writing">Grid typography was particularly hard for me to understand and execute. From what I researched, its main purpose is to define hierarchy throughout the given text, and create a form within that. So, I decided to once again take the text and put it into sections. I gave the artist’s name with his work and the place where the event would take place hierarchy above everything else at the top of the poster. I then proceeded to chunk pieces of text that went together and put them in order of importance down to the middle of the page. To catch the attention of a viewer, I also put green circles in seemingly random parts of the text. These were carefully placed to highlight the important pieces. 
    </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="typography_item">
    <img class = "type-image" src="images/modular-01.png">
    <p class="writing">Like Grid, modular typography was also challenging for me to visualize. There are many similarities between the two systems, as modular feels like it could fit within the grid system. I decided to create a visualizing piece that makes the viewer really look at the poster for information. Using a white background with a light green tilted square, I added 15 black squares above it to give a tile feel. I then spaced out my text within these tiles to let the viewer’s eyes wander around the poster, but still made sure to group them in ways of importance.
    </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="typography_item">
    <img class = "type-image" src="images/RADIAL typographic system-01.png">
    <p class="writing">With Radial typography, I felt like the best way to showcase it was to literally make a sun-like picture, with the text being the rays of the sun. I created a green circle, then added the text all along the right side of it. I separated some of the sentences and rotated them to give more structure to the rays and show movement. To add hierarchy, I bolded some of the important information, as well as highlighted words within sentences in the same green that was used in the circle.
    </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="typography_item">
    <img class = "type-image" src="images/random-01.png">
    <p class="writing">This system was my favorite to create. I didn’t really have a structure, so I just experimented with placing text in different areas of my poster and seeing what I could create from that placement. Once I had my placement of all my texts down, I then experimented with duplicating some of the words and placing them on top, around, and beside the originals to give a more “random” effect. I also added color throughout these duplicated words to show contrast, and I put in green circles with different shades around the poster to add more randomness. 

    </p>
</div>
    
    <div class="typography_item">
    <img class = "type-image" src="images/transitional-01.png">
    <p class="writing">Transitional typography is a great way to show motion throughout a poster. I decided to show motion by adding curves throughout my texts. This gave a wave effect throughout my design, and saved the piece from being uninteresting. Using the wave design, I layered my texts line by line to show depth. I also wanted to incorporate waves as drawings from the corners of my poster to really show movement.

<p>Typography is cool and all, but its real use is when it comes to life in
    posters. CUE THE CARP TASK!

    <div class="carpcontainer">
    <div class="carp_item">
    <img class = "carpimage"src="images/design1.png">
    <p class="carpwrite">As you can see, the True/False logo consists of three colours: red, white, and black. I wanted to stay true to these colours throughout my entire design, which would incorporate the repetition aspect of this project. I used a dark red background, with a lighter red opening to give a spotlight effect. I then used alignment with my texts, all tilting to the right in the same direction, and also highlighting important words throughout my sentences, trying to draw the viewer in. These sentences were evenly spaced between to show proximity. I also used drop shadows for the True/False Festival title along with the date and time, and logo to show contrast between the body sentences</p>
    </div>

    <div class="carp_item">
    <img class = "carpimage" src="images/design2FINAL.png">
    <p class="carpwrite">This is the poster I chose to improve. I wanted to go with a movie poster theme to show that this festival was indeed a film festival. I created a ticket stub that was slightly off-centre and showcased the name of the festival. Going along with the theme, I decided to create a popcorn bucket that had the True/False logo on the side of the box with popcorn bursting out of it. The popcorn is repeated throughout the poster to give the feel that it has been spilt. I then used my text between the popcorn going down the poster to make it seem as if it was spilt as well. I also played around with the colour scheme of this poster a lot, and ended up with the one that you see here. This scheme is supposed to give off a fun vibe that invites the viewer in to learn more about the event.

    <p>Making websites is cool and all, but as an inexpierienced coder,
        I had to start from ground zero. This next section will show worksheets that helped
        me develop the skills to make this very website.

<a id="CODE"></a>
<section class="coding-task">
    <h4 class = "coding-task">Coding Section</h4>
    <p>Throughout the first few weeks, I learned the basics of coding through worksheets. These worksheets 
        gave me abilities to make a website have functionality as well as style. Below are a few examples of what I've
        learned and used in this very website!
