    <h1> Welcome to my website! :) </h1>
                
    
    <p>Hi there! This is my very first website that I have ever completely coded by myself. 
    Withinn this website, you will find other projects that I've worked on throughout this first semester. 
    I will showcase a couple of poster designs, different types of typography, and much more.
    Having no expierence of coding before coming to this class, I feel very proud to showcase my work to everyone!
    Without further adue, here are multiple examples of different types of typography.
    </p>
                <button><a href="#TYPO">Typography</button></a>

    <p>Typography is cool and all, but its real use is when it comes to life in
        posters. CUE THE CARP TASK!

    <p>Making websites is cool and all, but as an inexpierienced coder,
        I had to start from ground zero. This next section will show worksheets that helped
        me develop the skills to make this very website.

<section class="coding-task">
    <h4 class = "coding-task">this is the coding task</h4>
    <p>This is the section where I will explain my choices with the coding worksheets, and 
        add a link towards them below this paragraph.

    <p>Create a short essay (approx. 2
        paragraphs), that explains the
        strategy and scope of your website.
        It will include who you think your
        users are. It will also include a basic
        list of the content that you will be
        including (and not including) in your
        website as well as the functional goals
        for your html website. </p>
