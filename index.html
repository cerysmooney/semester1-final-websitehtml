    <h1> Welcome to my website! :) </h1>
                
    
    <p>Hi there! This is my very first website that I have ever completely coded by myself. 
    Withinn this website, you will find other projects that I've worked on throughout this first semester. 
    I will showcase a couple of poster designs, different types of typography, and much more.
    Having no expierence of coding before coming to this class, I feel very proud to showcase my work to everyone!
    Without further adue, here are multiple examples of different types of typography.

    <div class="typocontainer">
    <div class="typography_item">
        <img class = "type-image" src="images/axialtest-01.png">
       <p class ="writing">This is my example of using axial typography.  I decided to use simplicity to my advantage, and created a slanted design starting from the top left of the poster, with a solid green line passing through the page. This created a perspective that allowed the text within the poster to be read more clearly. As you read the text, your eye travels in a flowing motion that shows the entirety of the poster, from top down.

    <div class="typography_item">
    <img class = "type-image" src="images/RADIAL typographic system-01.png">
    <p class="writing">With Radial typography, I felt like the best way to showcase it was to literally make a sun-like picture, with the text being the rays of the sun. I created a green circle, then added the text all along the right side of it. I separated some of the sentences and rotated them to give more structure to the rays and show movement. To add hierarchy, I bolded some of the important information, as well as highlighted words within sentences in the same green that was used in the circle.

</div>
    
    <div class="typography_item">
    <img class = "type-image" src="images/transitional-01.png">
    <p class="writing">Transitional typography is a great way to show motion throughout a poster. I decided to show motion by adding curves throughout my texts. This gave a wave effect throughout my design, and saved the piece from being uninteresting. Using the wave design, I layered my texts line by line to show depth. I also wanted to incorporate waves as drawings from the corners of my poster to really show movement.

<p>Typography is cool and all, but its real use is when it comes to life in
    posters. CUE THE CARP TASK!

    <p>Making websites is cool and all, but as an inexpierienced coder,
        I had to start from ground zero. This next section will show worksheets that helped
        me develop the skills to make this very website.
